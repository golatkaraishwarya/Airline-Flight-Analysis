# Airline-Flight-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using Power BI)

## Project Overview
2018 Airline Flight Analysis Project aims to provide a clear picture of all the significant airport data. The total number of flights , the total number of flight delays all included in the summary page dashboard of this project. In case of flight changes, emergencies, delays, this analysis could assist airport management authorities in making timely data-driven choices.

## Dataset
- You can use the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yuanyuwendymu/airline-delay-and-cancellation-data-2009-2018"> Airline delays and cancellation dataset </a> available on Kaggle. 

## Project Idea 
By analyzing this dataset, the goal is to present a comprehensive overview of various metrics such as flight delays, cancellations, and helping airport authorities address operational challenges. Follow these steps for the data visualization part:

## Flight Data Analysis Process
- Use Cards to display total airline, total airports, total flights, total distance, total air time.
- Plot Bar Charts to show flight analysis by airline.
- Plot Pie Chart to analyze the magnitude of flight delays based on various factors.
- Design Decomposition Tree to visualize flight status analysis for airport operations.
- Prepare Matrix to analyze months by flight status(on time flight, delayed flight, cancelled flight).

## Key Business Questions to Explore(KPIs)
- What are the patterns and trends in flight delays and cancellations over time?
- How do delays and cancellations differ by airline, destination, or time of day?
- What operational changes can be made to minimize flight delays and optimize ground processing time?
